Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:Initializing a repo means there's an empty audit log in the directory. Do this so you can add files to the audit log later.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: You can package stuff up that goes together.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: Keep dependent files together so they don't get out of sync.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: When you need to maintain a main piece of software but are also committed to developing something disruptive. A branch
would let you do disruptive stuff without impacting customers...in case you needed to ship interim bug fixes. Then later
you could merge the branches in a controlled fashion.
