Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:Initializing a repo means there's an empty audit log in the directory. Do this so you can add files to the audit log later.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: You can package stuff up that goes together.
