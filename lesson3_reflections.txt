Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When you plan to work on it from multiple computers (like home AND work). And especially when you plan to collaborate with other people on it.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Branching is making a temporary variation of a specific commit, often with
  the intent of merging back into the master at some point. All that branching
  can be on your own machine. Cloning is making a full copy of the repository,
  like if you wanted to create a new separate project to live on in parallel
  with the original project, but without intending to ever merge the two (like
  now you have a classical project and beside it you begin a jazz project).
  Forking is like cloning another's repository - still attributing creation to
  the originator - and now you can go to town and make it your own, both online
  where you can collaborate with others, and by cloning it to your local machine
  so you can have at it, create good stuff, then publish to the team project.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: I would almost always put my changes in a branch because you never know when you'll be interrupted and 
  then suddenly you're behind and have to manage that aspect of handling things changing out from under you.
  The larger the team with which you collaborate, the more likely there are to be significant changes to master
  while you're working. For a tiny change like a typo fix, where you have someone lined up to review your 
  pull request immediately, maybe I wouldnt bother with a branch, but only if it's something where I'll be "hot
  editing" for just a few minutes.
