Git will help find differences between 2 files
Version control is awesome because you always have an old version to fall back to
Shit happens
Always be able to run a diff to see what changed - some things change unintentionally
I like how it even calls out which line numbers changed, and show the exact characters that changed
So keep lines short if at all possible

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: I don't have to try things twice, as I can always see how I tried it before, inc comments about what did/didn't work

Q:What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A: Pros for manual saves include that you think you have something worth saving, and you probably just finished some logical bit you can comment upon
A: Cons for manual include forgetting to save
A: Cons for autosave might include saving over an error introduced by stupid keyboard or trackpad interpretations of what you wanted
A: Pros for autosave include power outage recovery

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: The files can be interdependent, like the .js, .html, and .css files

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Don't forget to scroll down to see all the lines rm'd and added
